# BatchHtoV
Batch Horizontal to Vertical Spectrum Ratio and Time Frequency Analysis utility.

Based on the HtoV Toolbox by Krischer: https://github.com/krischer/HtoV-Toolbox

This utility has been extended to implement HVTFA using the built-in ObsPy Morlet CWT. Original HVSR processing (multitaper, single taper, etc) has been maintained.
